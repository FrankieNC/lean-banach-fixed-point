# lean-banach-fixed-point
This repository contains a Lean formalisation of the **Banach Fixed Point Theorem** (also known as the **Contraction Mapping Theorem**), a fundamental result in metric space theory. The theorem guarantees the existence and uniqueness of fixed points for contraction mappings in complete metric spaces.

This project was completed as part of my coursework for the **Formalising Mathematics** module at **Imperial College London (2025)**. I chose this result because it's one of my personal favourites â€” elegant, powerful, and widely applicable across analysis and differential equations.

In addition to the Lean formalisation, I have included a short report explaining the theorem, the formalisation process, and some reflections on working with Lean and mathlib.
